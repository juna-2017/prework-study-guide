# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This Prework study guide was created for coding bootcamp students to utilize, while going through the Prework. The webpage was created to hold all information on one page resulting in an convenient location for students to gain useful information from one place. Often times, information is spread out and students will have to go through multiple channels and resources to learn. This website solves that issue and makes all information acccessible in one place.  

## Installation
